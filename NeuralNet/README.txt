Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
1) Where is the code?
The code is in the "neuralNet.py" file.

2) How do I run the program?
First, open up a Command Prompt. Second, navigate to the path that neuralNet.py is located at. Third, type in "python neuralNet.py" without the quotes. If you get an error about python not being recognized as an internal or external command, this means that the path variable is not set correctly. If you get a python error stating that it can't open the file because there is no such file or directory, this means that the file is not located in your current location (or you're spelling it wrong).

3) How do I change what the training set data is?
The "Table 1" data is located in "Test 1 Training Data.txt". The full data is located in "Test 2 Training Data.txt"

4) How do I redirect all the ouput of the program to a file for later analysis?
When running the program, type in "pyhon neuralNet.py > file.txt" to store the output in file.txt

5) What values will randomly generated weights fall within?
[-1, 1]

6) Why was this written in Python and not a more conventional language like C++?
Python is a very elegant language that is easy to use and to read once the reader gains an understanding of the syntax differences between Python and C++. There are many built-in functions for things like regular expressions and tokenization that make processes like reading data from a file or converting a string to an integer a trivial affair. There is garbage collection, so memory leaks are not an issue. Finally, the author wanted to expand his horizons and gain a better understanding of a new language, and the best way to do that is by practice.

7) Where are the user manual and simulation results?
In the "Documentation and Reports" Folder

8) What is the simplest way to test the program?
Hit 'N' for each question. This will train the NN on the full training data, randomly generate the weights, allow manual testing of the NN, and use the default settings for the NN.

8) What if I have a question not on this list?
